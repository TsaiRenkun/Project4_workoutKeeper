## Approach
		Plan,Trial,Incorporate
		Planning stage took 1 day. Coming up with an idea, and creating Tables for the data.
		Data management was the most difficult part of this project. As you will need to see what is necessary and what wasn't. The outcome was to learn more about react and to push myseld to create a one-page application

		Trial 
		The things I learnt along the way was very interesting, being able to see the Ajax request and full power of manipulating the data and changing what was on the screen was at first difficult to understand.

		Incorporate
		While I slowly understanding how to use MVC with React. It was very interesting because i felt that understanding the flow of the files was very important.

## Unsolved Problems
		There are some parts in my app that i still wish to change and improve on.
		1. To input more data into my Database to allow better insight on workouts.
		2. To make the page look more professional.
